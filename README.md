# goatfarm
This is a virtual goat gallery where the site owner can upload images and information about her goats. Starting with the index page, I used Django's Flatpages app to create it. For the Goat app I created four models, a Goat abstract base model, Buck model, Doe model, and a Photo model. I used a ForeignKey field to allow Nichole to create the parents and grandparents relationship. In this app I also used imagekit to create different sized images and thumbnails. To handle the photos I used a formview with a formset to allow the admin to add, update, or delete multiple images at once. In the Accounts app I created a CustomUser model and I also used SendGrid in the forms.py to allow for password reset for the site admin. Next I created a Contact app to allow visitors to contact the admin. In this app I used SendGrid to send the message to the admin's email. Finally I created a Review app to allow previous customers to leave a review, which is then displayed as a list.
